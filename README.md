# AskGPT
AskGPT is a electron-based desktop application that allows users to obtain answers to their questions by interacting with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's chatGPT model.

## Features
+ Graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction
+ Seamless integration with OpenAI's API
+ Quick response time
+ Display of relevant answers to user questions

## How It Works
Using the application is simple. The user inputs their question using the GUI and the application sends the question to the chatbot. The chatbot processes the question using natural language processing and machine learning techniques and returns the best possible answer. The application then displays the answer to the user in a clear and concise manner.
